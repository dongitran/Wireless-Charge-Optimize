# wireless-charge-optimize

Welcome to wireless-charge-optimize, our Battery Monitoring Application!

This innovative tool is designed to revolutionize your wireless charging experience.

It continuously monitors your phone's battery level and, when necessary, communicates seamlessly via MQTT to your wireless charger. This means your device will not only charge when it needs to but also stop charging intelligently, helping to extend your battery's lifespan.\
Say goodbye to overcharging and overheating issues, and say hello to enhanced battery health and device longevity
